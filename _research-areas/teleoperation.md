In the domain of human-machine interaction, the use of teleoperation can serve one or multiple purposes such as
compensating a system’s technical limitations with human oversight or multiplying human skills with the assistance of
superhuman machines.

For instance, an autonomous vehicle (AV) is always expected to correctly estimate whether it is safe to drive under the
current circumstances. When the autonomous driving mode cannot be enabled, a reliable teleoperation (in the form of
remote control) could serve as an alternative to getting the vehicle to its target location or closest maintenance area.

Teleoperation, however, poses a multitude of challenges, both technological and human-factors-related. In order to
ensure safe movement of a remote vehicle, the operator needs reliable overview of the vehicle’s surroundings (i.e. high
situational awareness) and responsive controls (e.g. low latency communication).
