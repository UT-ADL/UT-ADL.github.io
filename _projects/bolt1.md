This is what started it all. Bolt and the University of Tartu joined forces to start working on self-driving and, as a result, ADL was formed. The objective was to conduct applied research on autonomous cars: to evaluate the current state-of-the-art in autonomous driving technologies in a Level 2.5 vehicle and do research on technical alternatives that would eventually pave the way for Level 4 autonomous driving. It was decided that all research would follow a hands-on (i.e. experimental) approach, as much as possible.
