            The Autonomous Driving Lab of the University of Tartu was founded in 2019 in cooperation with the Estonian
            mobility company Bolt. We have set ourselves three overarching goals, one for each area that is of
            importance to us

                There are many ways of getting from A to B, just as there are many alternative approaches we could take
                to
                fulfill our goals.
                Thus, we follow certain principles that guide us in our day-to-day work and help us make

                    When it comes to software, we are most interested in harnessing the potential of artificial

                    We have set our sights on working towards full autonomy, rather than facilitate driver
                    assistance.
